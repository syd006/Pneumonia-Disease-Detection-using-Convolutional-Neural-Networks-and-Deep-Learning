# Pneumonia-Disease-Detection-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning
This project aims to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model can assist in the early diagnosis of pneumonia, potentially improving patient outcomes.
